# CoffeeSnake
This is my version of the classic 'Snake' arcade-style game. It was made using Java's AWT and Swing packages.


## What I learned:
* I learned how to better apply the principles of object oriented programming.
* I became more familiar with the Swing and AWT libraries

### Next Steps:
* Add a high-score tracker 
* Add a score indicator in the corner of the game window.
* Add sound effects
