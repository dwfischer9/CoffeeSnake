CoffeeSnake
This is my version of the classic 'Snake' arcade-style game. This was made to practice my Java skills regarding object oriented programming, as well as 
making a game, which I have only done in Python before.
Some things I would like to add for my own practice would be a high-score tracker, as well as a score indicator in the corner of the game window.
